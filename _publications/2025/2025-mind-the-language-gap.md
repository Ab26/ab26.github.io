      This paper introduces MMCRICBENCH-3K, a benchmark for Visual Question Answering on cricket scorecards designed to evaluate large vision-language models on complex numerical and cross-lingual reasoning over semi-structured tabular images. Empirical results show that state-of-the-art models struggle with structure-aware numerical reasoning and cross-lingual generalization.
